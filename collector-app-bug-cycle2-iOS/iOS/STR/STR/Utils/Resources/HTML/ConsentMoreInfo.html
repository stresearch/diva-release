Thank you for considering participating in this video dataset collection.<br /><br /><b>Purpose.</b>  Video camera networks allow security analysts to monitor buildings to keep the occupants safe.  However, the number of streaming videos generated by these cameras far exceeds the number of analysts needed for effective monitoring.    Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help solve this problem by detecting specific activities of interest in a video, and generating an alert for security personnel to review.  However, training an AI for this task requires many examples of many activities.  You are being asked to be an actor in a video of a specific activity for use in training an AI.  After recording the video, your video will be uploaded to us.  This video will be shared with the AI research community to improve the ability for AI to recognize human activities.<br /><br /><b>Risks.</b>  During the study, you will be recorded performing a simple activity or acting out a simple scene in view of the camera.  As any physical activity involves risk, you should only participate if these activities are within your abilities.  Your face will be visible in this video, and your face is your personally identifiable information.  By participating in this study, you acknowledge the risk that you may be identified in this video by someone.<br /><br /><b>Benefits.</b>> There are no direct benefits to you. This study will benefit the scientific community’s ablity to automatically detect activities in video streams.<br /><br /><b>Collection,</b>> sharing and use of information – Activity Videos.  You will be asked to record a video performing an activity.  Your activity video will be used to train an AI system for activity detection.  This will be used to improve this activity detection system over time by members of the AI research community. With your permission, your video will be shared widely and publicly for the purpose of improving AI.  However, if you do not give your permission for this video to be public but still want to contribute, we will share this video only with the data collection sponsors (${PROJECT_TEAM_MEMBERS}) and no one else.<br /><br /><b>Collection,</b> sharing and use of information – Demographics.  You will be asked a set of questions regarding your age range, gender and ethnicity.  You can choose not to answer these questions if you prefer.  We will also ask you for your hair color, hair length, presence or absence of facial hair and if you wear eyeglasses   This optional demographic information will be shared along with the activity videos for the purposes of improving AI.<br /><br /><b>Collection,</b> sharing and use of information – Location.  When your activity video is uploaded, we will optionally record the city, state and country (e.g. Cambridge, MA USA) of upload.  At no time will any position information be recorded from the GPS on your device.  This location will be shared along with the activity videos for the purposes of improving AI.  You can choose to not have this location shared, if you prefer. <br /><br /><b>Collection,</b> sharing and use of information – Face Videos.  You will be asked to record a video verbally affirming your consent for us to collect your activity video.  This consent video will only be used to verify that you are the person in your activity video.  This consent video will not be shared.  However, with your permission, we will also use your consent video for improving facial biometrics.  This will involve using your consent video to train facial biometrics systems to improve the ability to recognize faces, and sharing your consent video widely and publicly for the purposes of training AI.  If you do not give your permission, then we will only use this to verify that you are the person in your activity video and it will not be shared.<br /><br /><b>Data retention.</b>  With your permission, we will retain this video for as long as necessary to achieve the purpose of this data collection.  However, if you wish to have this video deleted after four years, we will do so at your request.  If you do not wish for us to save any video of you, please do not take part in this data collection.<br /><br /><b>Opt-out.</b>  If you change your mind, you can revoke your consent at any time in the future and all videos with you in them will be deleted.  You have control over your videos.  Revokation involves creating a new account in the mobile app using the same email address you provided during consent, then selecting the “Revoke Consent” button in your user profile.  All videos that include you as a subject will be deleted from this dataset.  Alternatively, you can send an email to consent@visym.com from your provided email address, and we will remove your videos for you.<br /><br /><b>Anonymity & Confidentiality.</b>  Your activity video will contain your face, which can be used to identify you in this video.  We will not record your location, your voice (except in the consent video), faces of non-consented people in the background or any other personally identifiable information about you.  We will respect your preferences to keep these videos confidential by restricting sharing at your request. <br /><br />Should you have questions about the study, please contact the study organizers at info@visym.com or 617.335.3311. <br /><br />If you have any questions about your rights as a volunteer in the research, or other questions, concerns or complaints about the study, please feel free to contact the New England IRB at 1-800-232-9570 and reference IRB protocol #2020-10188-2.&nbsp;
